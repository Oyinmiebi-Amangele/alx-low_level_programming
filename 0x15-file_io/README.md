# File I/O

This project was completed during the Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. The goal of this project was to learn how to handle files in the C programming language. It covers topics such as opening, closing, reading, and writing files, working with file descriptors, understanding system calls, and managing file permissions.

## Technologies

The files in this project are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4` and are written according to the C90 standard. The code has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Files

The project consists of the following C programs:

| Filename               | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0-read_textfile.c      | Reads a text file and prints its contents to the POSIX standard output |
| 1-create_file.c        | Creates a file                                                    |
| 2-append_text_to_file.c| Appends text at the end of a file                                  |
| 3-cp.c                 | Copies the content of one file to another file                     |
| 100-elf_header.c       | Displays the information contained in the ELF header of an ELF file|
