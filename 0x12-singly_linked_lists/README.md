# Singly Linked Lists

This project was done during my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. The aim of this project was to learn about linked lists in the C language.

## Technologies

- C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4.
- C files are written according to the C90 standard.
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
