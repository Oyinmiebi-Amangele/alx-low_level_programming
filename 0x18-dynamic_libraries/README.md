# Dynamic Libraries

This project was completed during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. The goal of the project was to enhance understanding of dynamic and shared libraries in the C programming language.

## Technologies

- Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
- C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files

| Filename              | Description                                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `libdynamic.so`     | Dynamic library containing various functions.           |
| `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh` | Shell script for creating a dynamic library.          |
| `100-operations.so`   | Dynamic library with mathematical functions.            |
| `101-make_me_win.sh`  | Shell script to inject a C program for game hacking.    |

Each file plays a specific role in exploring dynamic library concepts in C.
